An introduction to Man in the Middle attacks.

## Man in What ?
**Man-in-the-middle** is a cyberattack where the attacker **secretly relays** and possibly alters **the communications** between two parties who believe that they are directly communicating with each other, where in actuality the attacker has inserted themselves between the two user parties.

The attack that we are going to use is called **"ARP Spoofing"**.

### Example

## What is ARP ?
ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) is a network protocol used to determine the MAC address (hardware address) corresponding to an IP address.
